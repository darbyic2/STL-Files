# STL-Files

3D Prints that I have found useful. Mostly originating on thingiverse.

I decided to keep these in my own repository as I have had difficulty re-finding the same items later. 
Either the web page no longer existed or the design had since been modified in a way that did not suit me,
or I just plain couldn't find it again in amongst the mass of similar items.

Where I remembered, I have included a text file containing the URL of the original source of the files.
